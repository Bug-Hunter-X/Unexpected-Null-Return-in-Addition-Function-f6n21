This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating an uncommon bug related to null value handling in an addition function. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers; however, it returns `null` if either input is `null`, which may not always be the expected behavior. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.
